Let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed, not necessarily connected graph.
%A \emph{directed cycle} in $G$ is a sequence of distinct vertices $\{e_1,\dots,e_i\}\subseteq E$ such that 
A subset of vertices $M(G)\subset V$ is called a \emph{minimum feedback vertex set} if the subgraph induced by the removal of $M(G)$ from $G$ contains no directed cycles.
The problem of finding a minimum feedback vertex set in an arbitrary graph is known to be NP-hard even in sparse graphs~\cite{Fomin2006,Borradaile2019} and its decision version was one of Karp's original 21 NP-complete problems~\cite{Karp1972}.
Nonetheless, identifying minimum feedback vertex sets in directed graphs has applications in a number of disparate domains, including deadlock recovery in operating systems and computer engineering~\cite{OS,Lin2000}, and determining the inefficiency of Nash equilibria in game theory~\cite{Brown2019c}.


Recent years have seen considerable attention focused on deriving bounds on the cardinality of the minimum feedback vertex set for undirected graphs. For instance see bounds for planar graphs~\cite{Kelly2017}, hypercubes~\cite{Madelaine2008}, shuffles~\cite{Kralovic2003}, and further conjectures~\cite{Kowalik2010}.
However, there seems to be a lack of such results for the valuable case of directed graphs.
Accordingly, this note presents several simple upper bounds for this quantity for directed graphs as a function of the number of nodes and edges.

\section{Definitions}

\section{Results}
Our first result gives a tight upper bound for all directed (not necessarily connected) graphs as a function of the number of edges.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:main}
Let $G$ be a directed graph with edge set $E$.
Then
\begin{equation}\label{eq:main}
\alpha(G) \leq \left\lfloor\frac{|E|}{2}\right\rfloor.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
First we show the upper bound.
Let $G\in\gee$ be a directed graph, and let $M(G)$ be a minimum feedback vertex set of $G$.
We wish to show that 
\begin{equation}
2\alpha(G)\leq |E|.
\end{equation}
Enumerate the $m$ vertices in $M(G):=\{u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_m\}$.
%Define $E(M(G)):=\{
Define the sequence $\{G_i\}_{i=0}^m$ as follows: $G_0=G$, and $G_i$ is the digraph that results from the removal of $u_i$ and all incident edges from $G_{i-1}$.
By the definition of $M(G)$, each vertex $u_i$ is contained in at least one cycle in graph $G_{i-1}$.
Since each $u_i$ is contained in a cycle in $G_{i-1}$, it follows that at least 2 edges are incident on $u_i$ in $G_{i-1}$.
Since the sequence of graphs satisfies $E(G_{i})\subset E(G_{i-1})$, this means that for all $i=1,\ldots,m$, at least 2 unique edges are incident on vertex $u_i$ which are \emph{not} incident on $u_j$ for any $j<i$.
%
Thus, writing $E(M(G))$ to denote the set of edges incident on $M(G)$, we have that
\begin{equation}
\alpha(G)\leq|E(M(G))|\leq |E(G)|.
\end{equation}

To show the lower bound, we construct a family of graphs which satisfy~\eqref{eq:main} with equality for all $k$, where $|E|=k$.
Let $|V|=2\lfloor k/2\rfloor$, and let $E=\{(2i,2i-1)\cup(2i-1,2i)\ |\ i\in\{1,\ldots,|V|/2\}\}$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:graph}).
If $|E|$ is odd, define the single remaining edge between any feasible pair of vertices (e.g., $(1,3)$).
Since this graph contains exactly $|V|/2$ disjoint length-2 directed cycles, the cardinality of any minimum feedback vertex set is exactly $|V|/2$ (e.g., the set of odd-numbered vertices is such a set).
%
\end{proof}
